svg tag 
scalable vector graphics
by using svg tag we can create svg graphics in our HTML
<svg width="" height="">           // width and height are needed to be set , setting width and height will create an area inside which we can                                                                           
</svg>                               create graphics

the graphics, we create using svg are always clean that means the image we create is complete either we zoom in or zoom outset
pixels if image do not burst

for eg , to create circle 
<circle cx="" cy="" r="" fill="" stroke="" stroke-width="">
here cx and cy are the coordinates of center
r is the radius
fill is used to color circle(internally)
stroke is use to add border
stroke-width is use to increase border width 
here an example of creating three shapes in HTML using svg tag
<svg width="200" height="200">
  <circle cx="100" cy="100" r="50" fill="red" stroke="black" stroke-width="5" />
  <text x="65" y="100">circle shape</text>
</svg>
<svg width="200" height="200">
    <rect width="100" height="100" fill="red" stroke="green" stroke-width="5" />
    <text x="4" y="50">rectangle shape</text>
</svg>
<svg width="200" height="200">
    <line x1="20" y1="20" x2="100" y2="100" fill="red" stroke="green" stroke-width="5" />
</svg>
how to add a background image in HTML page

backgroung-image: no-repeat;
to repeat images only along x axis 
background-image: repeat-x;
similarly for along y axis
to position our image , we can write
background-position: left center;
background-position: right center;
background-position: center center;
background-position: left left;
background-position: right left;
background-position: center left;
background-position: left right;
background-position: right right;
background-position: center right;
to fix the image at a position we can background attachment to fix the image
background-attachment: fixed;

			there are many text related formatting in CSS
			for eg , <p>HTML and CSS</p>
	text formatting on this p tag can be like
	
	text-transform: uppercase or lowercase;
	                                           this is will make all the letters captial or smaller
	text-transform: capitalize;
	                                           this will make the first letter of each word , capitalize
	text-decoration: underline , overline , line-through;
											   this will make the words underlined , overline and line crossing it
                                  ( s and strike tags are alternatives for line-through property )
								  ( u is alternative for underline )
	letter-spacing: 10px;
											   this will make a gap of 10px between the letters
    word-spacing: 10px;
											   this will make a gap of 10px between the words
	text-shadow: 3px 4px 5px black;
											   use to give shadow effect
											   3px is horizontal effect
											   4px is vertical effect
                                               5px is blur effect											   
											   black is color of effect
	text-align: left , right , center , justify;
												justify will stretch each line so that every line has equal width like in newspaper or magazines
	direction: rtl;
	unicode-bidi: bidi-override;
	                                        this will change the direction of letters from right to left
	vertical-align: top , middle , bottom;
	                                      top will make the text vertically top
										  middle will make the text vertically middle 
										  bottom will make the text vertically bottom
	line-height: 1;
                        this will give space between two lines of 1
    
                                                      counter in CSS
if we want an automatic increment in value of a variable , then we use countring in our HTML
this is done like this,
body {
counter-reset: section;                                    // it can be assumed that we have a counter variable in our HTML which has some garbage value
}                                                             and by writing <counter-reset: section>, we reset the value of counter variable
                                                           // it can also be considered that counter variable is representing section 
h2::before {
counter-increment: section;                                // whenever something will be written before h2 tag , the value of counter will increase 
content: "section" counter(section)" : ";                  // in this line the content wriiten will be printed as it is
}
     
	                                                  CSS column count
it is used to align written text according to columns, by using this column count , we can align the text like in newspaper , magazines etc
eg , 
<div>---------------------------------------</div>
<style>
div {
column-count: 3;                                        // complete text will be grouped in 3 columns
column-gap: 10px;                                       // gap between columns will be of 10px
column-rule: 1px solid green;
</style>                                      
                                           GRADIENT EFFECT IN CSS
					 		there are two type of gradient effent in CSS
							linear and radial effects
				background-image: linear-gradient(pink , red);            // the color of background will fall from pink to red, linearlly
				by default gradient effect is from top to bottom , to change it to right to left or vice versa
				background-image: linear-gradient(to right , pink , green);             // to make effect from left to right
				
				                           2D transform methods
				 these methods are used to move elements in 2D 			 
				 eg: 
				 transform: translate(100px,50px);                     // move the element 100px from right and 50 px from top
				 transform: rotate(90deg);                             // rotate the element 90 degrees
				 transform: scale(2,3);                                // increase the size of element 2 times the width and 3 times the height
				 transform: skewX or skewY(10deg);
				 
				 
to add an external CSS in HTML 
we use link tag
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="---.css">
